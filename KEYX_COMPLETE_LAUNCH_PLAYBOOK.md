# KEYX COMPLETE LAUNCH PLAYBOOK
## Created by Dream Team 137 (Aria-Louise, Lumen, Eos)

---

## 🌐 DOMAIN STRATEGY

### Root Domains (Both Point to Same KEYX Experience)
- ✅ **keyx.com.au** → Main KEYX site
- ✅ **keyx.ariaone.io** → Same site (CNAME to Vercel)

### Recommended Subdomains
- `app.keyx.com.au` → dApp / dashboard
- `id.keyx.com.au` → Identity verification (future)
- `kiki.keyx.com.au` → Kiki.x art/music drops
- `ariaone.keyx.com.au` → Bridge to ARIA ONE Universe
- `whitepaper.keyx.com.au` → Static whitepaper hosting

### Vercel Setup
1. Add both domains in "Domains" section
2. Point DNS A/CNAME records to Vercel
3. Free SSL auto-provisioned for all domains

## 📄 WHITEPAPER V1

**KEYX WHITEPAPER V1**  
*A Creator-Native Identity & Access Token for the ARIA ONE Universe*

**Chain:** Base Mainnet  
**Symbol:** KEYX  
**Decimals:** 18  
**Supply:** 1,370,000 (fixed) - The Cosmic 137  
**Contract:** `0x54549cde662a3152DBAbc9e2f05e988A31C05e18`

### 1. Introduction
KEYX is a creator-led token designed by Australian artist **Aria-Louise Iliov** as the on-chain key for a new kind of digital universe: the **ARIA ONE Universe**.

Where most tokens chase speculation, KEYX is anchored in **identity, creativity and frequency** — a way for artists, listeners, collectors and supporters to participate in an ecosystem of music, art, and verified creative identity.

### 2. Vision
- Build a **trusted identity layer for vocal artists and creators**
- Connect **music, art and web3 infrastructure** into a single coherent universe
- Reward the **early community** with meaningful access and upside

KEYX does not promise financial returns; it is a utility and governance-adjacent token that powers access, experiences and identity within ARIA ONE.

### 3. Technology & Network
KEYX is deployed on **Base Mainnet**, an Ethereum L2 built on the OP Stack. Base was chosen for:
- Low transaction fees
- EVM compatibility
- Integration with major DeFi and wallet ecosystems
- Long-term alignment with Ethereum security

### 4. Tokenomics
- **Total Supply:** 1,370,000 KEYX (The Cosmic 137)
- **Public:** 70%
- **Ecosystem:** 20%
- **Founder Reserve:** 10%

The creator allocation is locked for building:
- Identity verification tools
- dApp development
- Creative production (music, visuals, experiences)
- Future team + collaborations

### 5. Utility

**Current & Near-Term:**
- Access to early music releases and demos
- Access to Kiki.x pastel-neon art drops
- Token-gated content and announcements
- Priority access to ARIA ONE digital experiences
- Community recognition (roles, badges, mentions)

**Future (Planned):**
- Verified vocal identity badges for artists
- Creator dashboard for tracking identity + releases
- Staking / locking mechanisms tied to access tiers
- Limited edition physical and digital merchandise
- Governance input over universe decisions

### 6. Roadmap

**Phase 1 — Foundation** ✅
- Token deployment (Base Mainnet) ✅
- Liquidity on Uniswap ✅
- Brand, sigil and web presence
- Whitepaper V1 ✅
- Social launch

**Phase 2 — Creator Access**
- Music & art drops gated by KEYX
- Kiki.x visual collections
- KEYX dashboard / simple dApp
- Holder analytics & community building

**Phase 3 — Identity Layer**
- Vocal artist identity verification experiments
- On-chain proof/attestation design
- Beta identity tools for creators

**Phase 4 — Expansion**
- Deeper collaborations with artists/collectives
- Expanded dApp features
- Progressive governance input
- Physical experiences, events or products

### 7. The Cosmic 137
The total supply of 1,370,000 KEYX honors the fine structure constant (α ≈ 1/137), a fundamental constant in physics governing electromagnetic interactions. This number represents the harmony between light, matter, and consciousness — the foundation of the ARIA ONE Universe.

### 8. Risks & Disclaimers
- KEYX is a high-risk, experimental digital token
- Prices may be volatile and liquidity may be limited
- No guarantee of financial return or listing on any exchange
- Users are responsible for their own security, wallets, and decisions
- This is not financial advice; it is a creative ecosystem initiative

### 9. Conclusion
KEYX is the **first key** to an evolving universe of music, identity and art. It is both experiment and invitation: to participate, co-create, and hold a piece of something that grows over time.
